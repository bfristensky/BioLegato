NetBeans doesn't seem to have a mechanism for creating a 
new version of a project. In particular, the bioLegato
project has custom ant scripts for doing the builds, 
so you really have to copy the directory tree intact.

 The best way to do this by hand:

1. Make a copy of the existing directory tree under a new name.

cp -RPp bioLegato.1.0.0 bioLegato.1.0.2

This command preserves symbolic links. The main project directory
has links to the jarfiles that are created each time the project
is built.

2. Edit src/ants.properties to change the version number

app.version=1.0.2 

During a build, the ant script tells and to replace variables in the source
code such as @VERSION@ with the values from this file. New .java files are
created in a number of build directories, and these are the java files
that actually get compiled.

3. In Netbeans:

    File --> Open Project
    choose the src directory 
    Click on Open Project

    If you wish, you may also select Run --> Set Main Project

4. Build the project

    The first time you build, choose Run --> Clean and Build

5. In the java directory, change the symbolic link bioLegato to point to the
   new bioLegato directory.

6. To test, launch any bioLegato eg. birch. In the Help --> About menu, 
   you should see the new version number.
