SYNOPSIS
    biolegato [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
    BioLegato is a customizable GUI for running programs.  Its initial intent is
    to be a replacement for GDE; however with its large plugin API, it may be
    customized to run more than just CLI programs.

    With the versatility of BioLegato's plugin interface, it supports a wide
    range of file formats which may be added to at any time through addition of
    plugins.

OPTIONS
  NOTE: All command line parameters are case insensitive and may optionally
        begin with -, --, or / to prevent confusion with filenames.  Options
        which are synonymous (e.g. --help and --h mean the same thing), are
        listed below, separated by commas.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    BioLegato searches for the following environment variables.
    If they don't exist BioLegato sets them to defaults.

        Default: uses .blproperties value OR command switch --debug
        Description: set to "true" to enable debug mode

      NOTE: in properties files, BL_DIR points to the directory where
            BioLegato is stored

        seqcolourdirs        The location to load the default sequence colour

                             "default" (with any extension).

    This properties class will read properties files from the directory
    containing BioLegato, the user directory and finally the directory BioLegato
    was launched from.  Please note that this behaviour can be changed using the

          appropriate environment variables if set.
