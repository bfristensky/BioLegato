Tasks for the unknown future:
-----------------------------
? optimize storage of GenBank file within sequence object (to use entire format specification)
? make biolegato support drag and drop
    http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/dnd/dropmodedemo.html
- emboss/acd menu converter
- Biolegato's own sequence file specification
- external group set features
- consider moving parts of biolegato to separate executables so as to further save on memory
- extract using binary objects (serialization)
- look into java multithreading -- be able to run jar files directly (saves memory)
    // see code from http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip127.html?page=2
- make a multi-lined menu object
    http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/toolbar.html
- Generate HTML in JWB
- make each canvas have its own menubar
- dynamic canvas
- conditional compilation http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4526113/java-conditional-compilation-how-to-prevent-code-chunks-to-be-compiled

Low priority:
- resize columns in bltables (automatically, or resize multiple columns)
- bltables colour masks

Version 0.7.12:
---------------
- rebuild test suite
    - core
    - gde support
    - table support
- database hooks
    - enable calling biolegato with a data source (table canvas)

Version 0.7.11:
---------------
- client server, with RMI - for writing an applet BioLeagto
- applet support
    - convert File object references to URL/URI references where possible
    - downloadable BioLegato client for connecting to BIRCH
- PCD additions and modifications
    - PCD menu pipelining (e.g. the ability to create a pipeline workflow in PCD that references other BioLegato menus)
    - find a way to add functions to PCD, or general scripting language that can be plugged into PCD.
    - allow multiple PCD exec sources??? (maybe PCD execpath?)
    - turtle shell PCD exec extensions
- work on making a separate pcd plugin, which can be generalized to any application!
- tutrleshell improvements
    - advanced internal commands
        - internal find, diff, patch
        - internal zip, unzip
        - make paste accept a command as input instead of a file (this is good practice for many commands because of cat)
    - make the command object able to accept Java strings and run commands when called from within Java
    - non-static environment hash (this is necessary for running turtle shell scripts).

Version 0.8.1:
---------------
- tutrleshell
    - for statements (based on string tokenizer)
    - improving expr functionality: http://ss64.com/bash/expr.html
    - add test: http://ss64.com/bash/test.html
    - add sed
    - add more
    - add rev (reverse the text on each line, but do NOT change the order the lines are printed),
    - add tac (cat, printing the lines in reverse order)
    - backward compatibility - mkdirs --> mkdir
    - fix date parameters
    - make turtle shell build script standalone (so it can be distributed separately)
    * fix "man" with no arguments
- BioLegato DB client for BIRCH, etc.
    * add a prompt feature to prompt for the database username and password
        * add a failskip feature to skip reading from the database, if the username and password are invalid
            i.e. don't worry if the username and password fail (just skip if things fail)
    * create DBPCD ( for storing schema information for databases)
        * stores schema in separate files - like menu items
    * create PCD mysql, jdbc, hsqldb shortcuts for entering driver names, etc.
    - add error checking to the database canvas (when saving entries in the DB)
        - check if a table or field already exists when selecting a name
        - no _ allowed in name (_ will be used for adding information for the computer in the back-end of the database)
    - test, test test!!!!
    - automatically create directories if they don't exist for schemas and database
    - if schema file exists but table does not (in DB) - create table in the database
    - make sure that the bldb client will not try to create tables if the name of the table is already in the DB (e.g. try creating another table called ggg - this should be disallowed)
        - use the select statement, etc. to test existence (?)
    * implement the save function for creating entries in the DB
        * for reference field, use a delete from table where key =, then insert ---- for updating
    - add delete entry feature!

    - Save choice in the File menu

Version 0.8.0:
---------------
- BioPCD submenus (?)
* BioPCD menu editor
    * see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/examples/components/TabComponentsDemoProject/src/components/TabComponentsDemo.java

    - add display menu tool
    - make it a BioLegato instance
    - add a menu item to BIRCH for importing menu items into BIRCH from the BioPCD editor
    - add doLayout, etc. to the JScrollPane! in the PCD editor

* BioLegato widget canvas
* make the PCD widget canvas accept a TSV file with values PROPERLY (i.e. multi-lined files) - using JavaCC!
* make the PCD canvas accept multilined values file
* remove list canvas in favour of a pure-PCD canvas replacement
* change the values file to read numbers for choosers, etc (using the widgets!)
* PCD SQL extensions (minor)
* create BioPCD demo wrappers - in BIRCHDEV
