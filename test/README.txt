This folder contains a stripped-down version of BIRCH with simple BioLegato applications:

bltable - simple generic spreadsheet
blfiles - simple file manager

This is a good place to experiment with BioLegato applications.

The quickest way to learn how to use BioLegato, and to make changes or add functions to
a BioLegato application, is to learn by doing. See
