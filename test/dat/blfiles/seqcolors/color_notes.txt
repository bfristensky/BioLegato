We need to have a menu that lets you select
the colors. It should work a lot like the 
.GDEmenus items. 

The user only sees the name of the scheme,
not the name of the file. There will be a 
file chooser at the bottom for a user-created
file. bioLegato should read the other files
by default. 

- Should default to all sequences, unless we check a box
that says color only the selected sequences

Need to look at the more complex color formats.
These all have ways of governing the colors
based on percentages, similarities etc. It may
be that at this lever of complexity, these things
just need to be hard-coded.

1) Hard code the nucleic acid/aminoacid coloring schemes
into bioLegato



2) One way is to create a mechanism for a menu item to
make bioLegato API calls. 

3)  directory
